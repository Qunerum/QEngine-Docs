    <h1>What is QEngine?</h1>
    <p>QEngine is a game engine written entirely in C#. It uses Avalonia for rendering, allowing applications to run across multiple platforms.</p>
    <p>The engine was designed with a focus on simple and direct game development, without relying on a built-in graphical editor. QEngine does not use a visual GUI editor, unlike popular engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine, or Godot.</p>
    <p>Project management is handled through the command line, using dedicated CLI commands responsible for:</p>
        <p>creating projects,</p>
        <p>searching for projects on disk,</p>
        <p>building applications,</p>
        <p>running games.</p>
    <p>QEngine is actively developed, with its features continuously improved and expanded.</p>
    <p class="note">The API may change in future versions of the engine.</p>
